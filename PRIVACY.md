# Privacy Policy for GitHub Repo Saver

**Last Updated:** December 2025

## Overview

GitHub Repo Saver is a browser extension that helps you save, organize, and manage your favorite GitHub repositories locally in your browser.

## Data Collection & Storage

### What We Collect
- **Repository Information**: We store repository metadata (name, owner, description, stars, language, topics) that you explicitly save
- **User Preferences**: Your categorization choices (role, status, custom tags, notes) are stored locally

### What We DON'T Collect
- ❌ No personal information (email, name, location)
- ❌ No browsing history outside of GitHub
- ❌ No authentication tokens or credentials
- ❌ No repository content (code, files, commits)
- ❌ No analytics or tracking data

## Data Storage

All data is stored **locally** in your browser using:
- **IndexedDB**: For repository data (when you have 200+ repos)
- **Chrome Storage API**: For smaller datasets and preferences

**Your data never leaves your device.** We do not transmit, sync, or store your data on any external servers.

## Permissions Explained

- **`storage`**: Required to save your repository list locally
- **`https://github.com/*`**: Required to access GitHub repository pages

## Third-Party Services

## Data Deletion

You can delete your data at any time by:
1. Removing individual repositories in the dashboard
2. Uninstalling the extension (this removes all local data)
